# NANDA Points System - Summary

## What Rahul Built (Core Payment System)

### 1. **MongoDB-Based Payment Infrastructure**
- TypeScript + Express + MongoDB payment system
- Double-entry accounting with integer minor units (scale=3)
- WebSocket support for real-time transaction broadcasting
- Idempotency handling to prevent duplicate transactions

### 2. **Core Data Models**
- **Agent Model**: DID-based identity with Facts integration
- **Wallet Model**: Balance tracking with spending limits
- **Transaction Model**: 9 transaction types with double-entry postings
- **Event Model**: Real-time event broadcasting system

### 3. **Transaction Engine**
- Supports 9 transaction types: mint, burn, transfer, earn, spend, hold, capture, refund, reversal
- Double-entry bookkeeping with proper debit/credit postings
- Business rule enforcement (insufficient funds, wallet status, overdraft limits)
- MongoDB atomicity and idempotency handling

### 4. **RESTful API**
- Complete REST API for agents, wallets, and transactions
- DID resolution and wallet management
- Transaction creation and querying
- Health monitoring endpoints

## What You Added (Reputation Verification System)

### 1. **Reputation-Based Security**
- Encrypted reputation scores in transactions
- Public/private key cryptography for secure verification
- Transaction eligibility checking based on reputation
- Backward compatibility with existing transactions

### 2. **Core Components**
- **ReputationVerifier**: RSA encryption/decryption with OAEP padding
- **AgentReputationSigner**: Reputation score encryption
- **TransactionReputationService**: Eligibility checking and requirements
- **Enhanced Transaction Engine**: Integration with existing system

### 3. **Reputation Requirements**
- Dynamic requirements by transaction type and amount
- Score range: 0-100 with timestamp validation
- Agent DID verification to prevent impersonation
- 1-hour window for replay attack prevention

### 4. **New API Endpoints**
- `POST /transactions/with-reputation`: Enhanced transaction creation
- `POST /reputation/initialize`: Initialize reputation service
- `POST /reputation/generate-keys`: Generate verifier key pairs
- `GET /reputation/requirements`: Get reputation requirements

### 5. **Security Features**
- RSA-OAEP encryption with SHA-256 hashing
- Timestamp validation and agent DID verification
- Score range validation and error logging
- Comprehensive demo and testing system

## Key Benefits

**Rahul's System**: Reliable payment processing, scalable MongoDB architecture, real-time events, comprehensive API, type safety

**Your Addition**: Trust-based transaction filtering, cryptographic security, flexible requirements, backward compatibility, enhanced security
